# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-Analysis
This project explores and analyzes Uber ride request data to identify the root causes of unfulfilled trip requests — focusing on cancellations and "No Cars Available" issues — and offers strategic recommendations for optimizing driver allocation and improving customer experience.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Analyze Uber ride data to uncover supply-demand mismatches and operational inefficiencies.
- **Tools Used:** SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Excel (Pivot Tables, Dashboard)
- **Dataset Size:** 6,745 ride-level records
- **Deliverables:** SQL analysis scripts, Python EDA notebook, Excel dashboard, and insight presentation

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- SQL (MySQL)
- Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Microsoft Excel
- PowerPoint (for insights PDF)

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

1. Total number of ride requests and distribution by status
2. Requests by pickup point and hourly trends
3. Analysis of ride failures by hour and day
4. Supply-demand gap calculation
5. Driver utilization rates
6. Time-slot-based and location-based service failures
7. Excel-based dashboards for operational monitoring

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- **High Cancellations:** Especially during Morning (5–9 AM) and Evening (5–9 PM) rush hours
- **Airport Pickup Issues:** High demand but lower fulfillment rate
- **Underutilized Drivers:** Certain drivers show low ride completion despite being assigned
- **Uneven Distribution:** Time-slot-based gaps impact rider experience

---

## 📌 Recommendations

1. **Dynamic Driver Scheduling** during high-demand slots
2. **Predictive Allocation Models** based on historical demand
3. **Time-based Incentives** for driver engagement
4. **Location-based Monitoring** for real-time gap reduction

## ✅ Conclusion

This end-to-end project demonstrates how a combination of SQL, Python, and Excel can be used to derive data-driven insights and suggest actionable strategies for ride-hailing platforms like Uber.
